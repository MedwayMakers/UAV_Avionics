# UAV_GPS_Code
Code for the UAV GPS section

This code will use the TinyGPS++ library to pull data over a 9600 baud serial line from a GPS module (we are using uBlox Neo-6) and display it on an ILI9341 colour LCD display.

Data is also sent over the serial line to be displayed on the Serial Monitor window for debugging purposes.
